## Project Overview

This **Sales Insight Dashboard** is a dynamic, executive-level data product built using **Power BI** to track real-time performance across car sales, dealership activity, vehicle types, and regional trends.

The dashboard provides a complete **year-to-date (YTD)** and **month-to-date (MTD)** breakdown of key automotive KPIs including total sales revenue, units sold, average price fluctuations, and segmentation by **body style, color, brand, and dealer location**.

> As seen in the image above, this dashboard combines **interactive filters**, **geo-intelligence**, and **sales diagnostics** in one sleek, dark-themed interface that highlights business-critical insights at a glance.
